      In this project, we are exploring movies data base from IMDB and Rotten tomato. There are a lot of factors to consider, such as the director, the actors, and the movieâ€™s budget so on.
      We will explore few data set in this project.
      IMDB data collected from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/">IMBD interfaces</a>. The data is minimally cleaned up by filtering for movies that have at least one vote and associated length information, and info on TV episodes or shows is also not included, but the data is otherwise directly (after parsing) from IMDB. The legend is interactive (try clicking the rectangles!).

As you can see this chart visualizes the number of genre movie releases between 1915 and 2013, as well as the total number of movies in those years.
A single movie may be associated with zero, one, or multiple genres and so the 'Total Movies' line corresponds to actual
movie counts and every colored-in area represents the number of movies tagged with that genre for that year.
The clear conclusion is that there has been an explosion in film production from the 90s onward, for which I have some theories but no definitive explanation. Beyond the big takeaway there are a multitude of possible smaller conclusions regarding the relative popularity of genres and movies overall, which was really my intent in making such an open-ended visualization.
